# Car-Price-Predictor
CAR PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the price of a car based on various features using a Linear Regression Model. The model is trained on historical car price data and learns the relationship between features such as brand, model, year, engine capacity, mileage, fuel type, and transmission to predict an estimated selling price.

Objective
Develop a predictive model to estimate car prices based on given attributes.
Use Linear Regression, a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm, to find the relationship between features and price.
Help potential buyers and sellers get a fair price estimation based on real-world data.
Dataset
The dataset contains multiple car features, including:

Car Name (Brand & Model)
Year of Manufacture
Mileage (Kilometers driven)
Engine Capacity (CC)
Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG/Electric)
Transmission Type (Manual/Automatic)
Selling Price (Target Variable)
Technologies & Tools Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
NumPy & Pandas (Data Preprocessing & Analysis)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)        
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning - Linear Regression)

Methodology
Data Collection: Importing a dataset of used car prices.
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and scaling numerical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data trends through visualization.
Model Selection & Training: Implementing Linear Regression and training it on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Measuring performance using RÂ² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Prediction & Deployment: Predicting car prices based on new input data.
Results & Accuracy
The model successfully predicts car prices with reasonable accuracy. The performance is evaluated using various error metrics, and optimizations can be made by feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, or using advanced regression techniques.

Future Enhancements
Implementing Polynomial Regression or Random Forest Regression for better accuracy.
Deploying the model using a web app (Flask/Streamlit).
Using real-time car price data for improved predictions.
